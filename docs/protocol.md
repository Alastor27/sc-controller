SCCDaemon Protocol specification
--------------------------------

To control running daemon instance, unix socket in user directory is used.
Controlling protocol uses case-sensitive messages terminated by newline. Message type and message arguments are delimited by `:`.

When new connection is accepted, daemon sends some info:

```
SCCDaemon
Version: 0.2.6
PID: 123456
Current profile: filename.sccprofile
Ready.
```

Connection is then held until client side closes it.


### Messages sends by daemon:

#### `Current profile: filename.sccprofile`
Sent to every client when profile file is loaded and used. Automatically sent when connection is accepted and when profile is changed.

#### `Event: source values`
Sent to client that requested locking of source (that is button, pad or axis).

List of possible events:
- `Event: B 1` - Sent when button is pressed. *B* is button, is one of *SCButtons.\** constants.
- `Event: B 0` - Sent when button is released. *B* is button one of *SCButtons.\** constants.
- `Event: STICK x y` - Sent when stick position is changed. *x* and *y* are new values.
- `Event: LEFT x y` - Sent when finger on left pad is moved. *x* and *y* is new position.
- `Event: RIGHT x y` - Sent when finger on right pad is moved. *x* and *y* is new position.

#### `Error: description`
Sent to every client when error is detected. May be sent repeadedly, until error condition is cleared.
After that, `Ready.` is sent to indicate that emulation works again.

#### `Fail: text`
Indicates error client that sent request.

#### `OK.`
Indicates sucess to client that sent request.

### `OSD: tool param1 param2...`
Send to scc-osd-daemon when osd-related action is requested.
*tool* can be *'message'* or *'menu'*, *params* are same as command-line arguments for related
scc-osd-* script.

#### `PID: xyz`
Reports PID of *scc-daemon* instance. Automatically sent when connection is accepted.

#### `Ready.`
Automatically sent when connection is accepted to indicate that there is no error and daemon is working as expected.

#### `Reconfigured.`
Sent to all clients when daemon receives `Reconfigure.` message.

#### `SCCDaemon`
Just identification message, automatically sent when connection is accepted.
Can be either ignored or used to check if remote side really is *scc-daemon*.

#### `Version: x.y.z`
Identifies daemon version. Automatically sent when connection is accepted.

## Commands sent from client to daemon

#### `Lock: button1 button2...`
Locks physical button, axis or pad. Events from locked sources are not processed normally, but sent to client that initiated lock.

Only one client can have one source locked at one time. Second attempt to lock already locked source will fail and `Fail: cannot lock <button>` will be sent as response. Locking is done only if all requested sources are free and in such case, daemon responds with `OK.`

While source is locked, daemon keeps sending `Event: ...` messages every time when button is pressed, released, axis moved, etc...

Unlocking is done automatically when client is disconnected, or using `Unlock.` message.

#### `Observe: button1 button2...`
Enables observing on physical button, axis or pad. Works like Lock, but events from observed sources are processed normally and to client at same time.

Any number of clients can observe same source, so upon this requests, daemon always responds with `OK.`
While source is observed, daemon keeps sending `Event: ...` messages every time when button is pressed, released, axis moved, etc...

Unlocking is done automatically when client is disconnected, or using `Unlock.` message.

#### `OSD: text to display`
Asks daemon to display OSD message. No escaping or quoting is needed, everything after colon is displayed
as text.

If OSD cannot be used (for example because daemon runs without X server), daemon responds with `Fail: ....` message.
Otherwise daemon responds with `OK.`. Note that doesn't necessary mean that OSD is visible to user, only
that scc-daemon managed to send request to scc-osd-daemon.

#### `Profile: filename.sccprofile`
Asks daemon to load another profile. No escaping or quoting is needed, everything after colon is used as filename, only spaces and tabs are stripped.

If profile is sucessfully loaded, daemon responds with `OK.` to client that initiated loading and sends `Current profile: ...` message to all clients.

If loading fails, daemon responds with `Fail: ....` message where error with entire backtrace is sent. Backtrace is escaped to fit it on single line.

#### `Reconfigure.`
Asks daemon to reload configuration file (`~/.config/scc/config.json`).
Currently, daemon doesn't really reads this file, but sends `Reconfigured.` message
to all connected clients, what should cause them to reload configuration file as well. 
Daemon responds with `OK.`

#### `Register: value`
Send by scc-osd-daemon and scc-autoswitch-daemon to register their client connections.
When sent with same value with two or more clients, daemon will automatically close former connection
before registering new one.
scc-osd-daemon sends `Register: osd`
scc-autoswitch-daemon `Register: autoswitch`
Daemon responds with `OK.`

#### `Selected: menu_id item_id`
Send by scc-osd-daemon when user chooses item from displayed menu.
If menu_id or item_id contains spaces or quotes, it should be escaped.
Daemon responds with `OK.`

#### `Unlock.`
Unlocks everything locked with `Lock...` and `Observe...` messages sent by same client.
It is not possible to unlock only one input or only one type of lock.

This operation cannot fail (and does nothing if there is nothing to unlock), so daemon always responds with `OK.`
